## Some intro in breif
Hi, I am a student of class 10 of Umakanta Academy English Medium School, I am from Tripura,Agartala,Santipara.
Since childhood, had a really great interest in computers, (though never used to like computer classes at school), slowly as i grew up, my interest in computers increased, and now i am literally in love with computers and computer programming!, i know C++ and Python, and some basic web development(though I dont like javascript..).
I can write pretty much good paragraphs and articles, that's not an hobbie just something i can do.Besides these i play guitar, and Love doing mathematics.
But, the most important of all is my dream, I want to become a great data scientist one day , and I will become one for sure!
